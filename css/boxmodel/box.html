       <h3> HTML</h3>
       <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It's a text-based approach that uses tags and attributes to define the content and formatting of a web page, and tells web browsers how to display it.

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a computer language that's used to structure and present web pages written in HTML or XML. CSS is made up of coding elements and cascading style sheets, also known as CSS files (.css). CSS is a rule-based language that defines groups of styles to apply to specific elements or groups of elements on a web page. For example, you can use CSS to make the main heading on a page appear as large red text.
